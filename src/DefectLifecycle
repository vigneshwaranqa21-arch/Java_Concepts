1.Explain in detail about Defect Reporting and its sample template.


Defect reporting is the process of logging issues found during testing with complete evidence
Its goal is to help developers reproduce, analyze, and fix defects quickly.

A good report is clear, concise, reproducible, and includes environment details.


| Field                | Description / Example                                      |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Defect ID            | DEF-2025-001                                               |
| Title                | Login button click not triggering authentication           |
| Severity / Priority  | Critical / High                                            |
| Environment          | QA Env / Chrome 120 / Windows 10                           |
| Steps to Reproduce   | 1. Navigate to login page                                  |
|                      | 2. Enter valid username and password                       |
|                      | 3. Click on the Login button                               |
| Expected Result      | User should be logged into the dashboard                   |
| Actual Result        | Login button is unresponsive; no action occurs             |
| Attachments          | login_button_issue.png / console_error_log.txt             |




2. Difference between Not a Defect and Duplicate Defect. Give some examples.


Not a Defect: Behavior is correct as per requirement; tester misunderstood the functionality.

Example: Requirement says “Password must auto-expire after 60 days” → Tester reports it as bug; dev marks it “Not a defect”.


Duplicate Defect: Same issue already exists in the defect tracker.

Example: Two testers raise the same login crash issue → second one marked “Duplicate”.

Key Difference: Validity (Not a Defect) vs Redundancy (Duplicate).


3. What will be the status of defect when the developer accepts the defect and starts to work on it?


Status becomes “In Progress”.

This indicates the developer has acknowledged the defect.

Work has started on analyzing and applying the fix.

It moves out of the Open/Assigned state.

Used to showcase active development on the issue.



4.If a tester tests the fix of a defect and found that it is not fixed. He will change the defect status to which state and why?


Tester changes status to “Reopen”.

Reason: The expected fix is not working or issue still reproducible.

Reopened defects go back to the developer for re-fixing.

Indicates failed retesting.

Ensures defect lifecycle loops properly.



5.Difference between Defect and Failure with examples. 

	Defect: A flaw in the software that causes it to behave unexpectedly.
	
	Example: A missing validation on email format in registration form.
			
	Failure: When the software does not perform as expected during execution.
			
	Example: Application crashes when user submits invalid email format.
	
	Key Difference: Defect is the root cause; Failure is the observable effect.
