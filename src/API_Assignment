1. Difference between PUT and POST with examples
POST is used to create a new resource on the server.
PUT is used to update or replace an existing resource.
POST is non-idempotent; multiple calls create multiple records.
PUT is idempotent; multiple calls give the same result.
Example: POST /users → create user, PUT /users/10 → update user 10.

2. Explain different HTTP Status Codes
1xx – Informational responses (request received).
2xx – Success responses (200 OK, 201 Created).
3xx – Redirection responses (301 Moved Permanently).
4xx – Client errors (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found).
5xx – Server errors (500 Internal Server Error).

3. Explain how API works with example
Client sends a request to API endpoint.
Request contains URL, method, headers, and body.
Server processes the request and accesses database.
Server sends response with status code and data.
Example: GET /products → returns product list in JSON.
