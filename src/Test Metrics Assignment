1.Explain about Test Metrics with examples.

 Test Metrics are quantitative measures used to assess the quality and effectiveness of the testing process.
 
 They help track progress, identify bottlenecks, and improve testing strategies.
 
 Examples:
 
 Defect Density: Number of defects per size of the software (e.g., per 1000 lines of code).		
 Test Case Execution Rate: Percentage of test cases executed over total planned test cases.
 Test Pass Rate: Percentage of test cases that passed successfully.
 Defect Resolution Time: Average time taken to fix reported defects.
 Test Coverage: Percentage of requirements or code covered by test cases.
 
 
2. Explain about different types of metrics.
There are several types of test metrics used to evaluate different aspects of the testing process:

1. **Product Quality Metrics**: Measure the quality of the software product itself.

   - Example: Defect Density, Defect Leakage.

2. **Process Metrics**: Evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the testing process.

   - Example: Test Case Execution Rate, Test Pass Rate.
   
3. **Project Metrics**: Track the progress and status of the testing project.
   
   - Example: Test Completion Percentage, Defect Resolution Time.
   			

 
 3. Explain about Test Plan and its template.
 	
 	A Test Plan is a formal document that outlines the testing strategy, objectives, resources, schedule, and scope for a software project.
 
 	It serves as a roadmap for the testing team and stakeholders to ensure all aspects of testing are covered.
 	
 	Test Plan Template:
 	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 	| Section               | Description                                        | 	
 	|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
 	| Test Plan ID          | Unique identifier for the test plan                |
 	| Introduction          | Overview of the project and testing objectives     |
 	| Scope                 | Features to be tested and out of scope             |
 	| Test Strategy         | Overall approach to testing (types, levels)        |
 	| Test Environment      | Hardware, software, and network configurations     |
 	| Test Schedule         | Timeline for testing activities                    |
 	| Resources             | Team members, tools, and other resources needed    |
 	| Deliverables          | Documents and reports to be produced               |
 	| Risks and Mitigation  | Potential risks and their mitigation strategies    |
 	| Approval              | Sign-off from stakeholders                         |
 	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------	
 		
		 			
4. Explain about Test Strategy and its template.	
		 			
A Test Strategy is a high-level document that defines the testing approach, objectives, resources, and schedule for a software project.
It provides a framework for the testing process and ensures alignment with project goals.

Test Strategy Template:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Section               | Description                                                        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Test Strategy ID      | Unique identifier for the test strategy                            |
| Introduction          | Overview of the project and testing objectives                     |
| Testing Objectives    | Goals and objectives of the testing effort                         |
| Test Levels           | Different levels of testing (unit, integration, etc.)              |
| Test Types            | Types of testing to be performed (functional, non-functional, etc.)|
| Test Environment      | Hardware, software, and network configurations                     |
| Test Tools            | Tools and technologies to be used                                  |
| Test Schedule         | Timeline for testing activities                                    |
| Resources             | Team members, tools, and other resources needed                    |
| Risks and Mitigation  | Potential risks and their mitigation strategies                    |
| Approval              | Sign-off from stakeholders                                         |

5.  What is Risk-Based Testing and when will you use that?

Risk-Based Testing (RBT) is a testing approach that prioritizes testing efforts based on the risk of failure and its potential impact on the project.
It focuses on identifying high-risk areas and allocating resources to test those areas more thoroughly.

When to use RBT:
	
When project timelines are tight and resources are limited.

When certain features or components are critical to business operations.

When there is a history of defects in specific areas of the application.

When regulatory compliance or security is a concern.

When testing complex systems with many interdependencies.
