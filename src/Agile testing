* No defined roles or time-boxed iterations.
* Best suited for support and maintenance projects.

3. Agile Testing – When & Why

* Agile testing is useful when requirements change frequently.
* Testing is done continuously along with development.
* Early defect detection reduces cost and rework.
* Testers collaborate closely with developers and business.
* Ensures faster feedback and better product quality.

4. TDD (Test Driven Development)

* TDD is a development approach where tests are written before code.
* Follows Red → Green → Refactor cycle.
* Red: write failing test, Green: write code to pass, Refactor: optimize.
* Improves code quality and test coverage.
