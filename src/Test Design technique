1.Explain about Boundary Value Analysis and Write a test case for that ?

Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)

Technique to test values at the boundaries of input ranges.

Defects often occur at the minimum, maximum, just below, and just above limits.

Focuses on edge values rather than full range.

Example Requirement: Age must be between 18 and 60.

BVA Test Cases:

17 → Invalid

18 → Valid

19 → Valid

60 → Valid

61 → Invalid

2. Explain about Equivalence Partitioning and Write a test case about that ?

Technique that divides input data into valid and invalid classes.

From each partition, only one representative test value is enough.

Reduces total test cases while maintaining good coverage.

Example Requirement: Age must be between 18 and 60.

EP Test Cases:

Invalid partition (<18): 10

Valid partition (18–60): 30

Invalid partition (>60): 75
