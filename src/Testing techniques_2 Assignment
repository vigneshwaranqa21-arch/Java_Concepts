1.Difference between State Transition Testing and Use Case Testing?


State Transition Testing: Focuses on system behavior when moving from one state to another based on events/inputs.

Use Case Testing: Focuses on user interactions and end-to-end flows based on functional requirements.

State Transition checks valid/invalid transitions; Use Case checks real user scenarios.

State Transition is event-driven; Use Case is goal-driven.

State Transition uses diagrams/tables; Use Case uses narratives and actors.




2.Create a Usecase Diagram for Banking where user can register, login,check balance,transfer funds and admin can register,login,delete account details,update account details

Use Case Diagram – Banking System (Textual Representation)

Actors:

User

Admin

User Use Cases:

Register

Login

Check Balance

Transfer Funds

Admin Use Cases:

Register

Login

Delete Account

Update Account


          +------------------------+
          |      Banking System    |
          +------------------------+
User -----------------> (Register)
User -----------------> (Login)
User -----------------> (Check Balance)
User -----------------> (Transfer Funds)

Admin ----------------> (Register)
Admin ----------------> (Login)
Admin ----------------> (Delete Account)
Admin ----------------> (Update Account)


3.  Explain about State Transition Testing in detail with example State Transition Table for a Shopping site.

State Transition Testing checks how the system behaves when moving between different states based on user actions.

Useful when the application's response depends on previous state (e.g., login flows, shopping carts, banking).

Ensures valid transitions work and invalid transitions trigger proper errors.

Example: Shopping Site – Add to Cart & Checkout Flow

States:

S1: Not Logged In

S2: Logged In

S3: Item Added to Cart

S4: Checkout Completed

Events:

E1: Login

E2: Add Item

E3: Checkout

E4: Logout


| Current State      | Event    | Next State         | Expected Result                   |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Not Logged In      | Login    | Logged In          | User successfully logged in       |
| Logged In          | Add Item | Item Added to Cart | Item added to cart                |
| Item Added to Cart | Checkout | Checkout Completed | Order placed successfully         |
| Item Added to Cart | Logout   | Not Logged In      | Cart cleared; user logged out     |
| Not Logged In      | Checkout | Not Logged In      | Error: Must login before checkout |
| Logged In          | Checkout | Logged In          | Error: Cart empty                 |
