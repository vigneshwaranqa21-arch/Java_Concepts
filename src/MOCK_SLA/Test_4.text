1. Explain about Experience based testing techniques?


Error Guessing – Tester predicts defects based on intuition and past failures.

Exploratory Testing – Simultaneous test design, execution, and learning.

Checklist-Based Testing – Using predefined checklists from past projects.

Ad-hoc Testing – Unstructured testing based purely on tester’s knowledge.

Boundary or Attack-Based Testing – Focusing on areas historically vulnerable to defects.


2. Explain about Defect Life Cycle ?

New → Assigned → Open/In-Progress (Developer starts working).

Open/In-Progress → Fixed (Developer provides the fix).

Fixed → Retest (Tester validates the fix).

Retest → Verified → Closed (If working fine).

Retest → Reopened → Assigned (If the issue still exists).



3.Explain about test metrics?

Test metrics quantify testing progress, quality, and efficiency.

They track areas like execution rate, defect trends, and coverage.

Key metrics: Defect Density, Test Coverage, Pass/Fail %, Defect Leakage.

Metrics highlight risks, bottlenecks, and overall product health.

They support decision-making for release readiness and process improvement.
