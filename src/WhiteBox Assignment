1.Write 3 examples explaining about White Box Testing.


Three Examples of White Box Testing

Example 1 – Code Coverage Testing

Verifying all statements, branches, and conditions are executed.

Example: Ensuring all if–else paths in a login function are tested.

Example 2 – Loop Testing

Checking loop entry, exit conditions, and boundary iterations.

Example: Validating a for loop that processes 1–10 items runs correctly for 0, 1, 10, and 11 items.

Example 3 – Path Testing

Ensuring every unique path through the code logic is executed once.

Example: Testing all possible paths in a payment validation method.


2. Prepare a small diagram / table about white box testing.

| Technique          | Purpose                           | Example                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Statement Coverage | Execute all lines of code         | Test all login validations        |
| Branch Coverage    | Execute all branches (true/false) | Test both valid/invalid OTP flows |
| Path Coverage      | Execute all logical paths         | Payment routing logic             |
| Loop Testing       | Validate loops and boundaries     | Iterating cart items              |


3. Summarize key challenge and solutions related to White Box Testing.

Challenges:

Requires deep programming knowledge.

Hard to test large, complex code structures.

Time-consuming due to many paths & branches.

Maintenance effort increases with code changes.

Solutions:

Use tools like JaCoCo, JUnit, SonarQube for coverage automation.

Break code into smaller modular functions.

Follow coding standards to reduce complexity.

Maintain updated documentation of code logic.


4. Create at least 2 Testcase demonstrating White Box Testing.

Test Case 1 – Branch Coverage for Login Function

Code Under Test

if(username == null) return "Invalid";
if(password == null) return "Invalid";
if(username.equals("admin") && password.equals("123")) return "Success";
else return "Failed";


Test Case

TC ID	Input (username, password)	Execution Goal	Expected Output
TC01	null, "123"	Cover null username	Invalid
TC02	"admin", null	Cover null password	Invalid
TC03	"admin", "123"	True branch success	Success
TC04	"admin", "999"	False branch failure	Failed


Test Case 2 – Loop Testing for Cart Calculation

Code Under Test (Simplified)

int sum = 0;
for(int i=0; i<items.length; i++){
   sum += items[i];
}
return sum;


Test Case

TC ID	Input (items array)	Loop Behavior Tested	Expected Output
TC01	[]	Loop runs 0 times	                0
TC02	[100]	Loop runs once	                100
TC03	[10,20,30]	Loop runs multiple times	60
