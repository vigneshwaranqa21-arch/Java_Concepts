1. Difference Between Experience-Based Testing and Formal Testing
Experience-Based Testing? 


Relies on tester’s knowledge, intuition, and past project experience.


Useful when documentation is limited or time is short.


Detects practical, real-world defects quickly.


Examples: Error Guessing, Exploratory Testing.


Formal Testing:


Follows structured processes, documentation, and predefined test cases.


Based on requirements, standards, and coverage criteria.


Ensures systematic, measurable, and traceable testing.


Examples: Boundary Value Analysis, Equivalence Partitioning, State Transition Testing.



2.Explain about checklist based testing.

Checklist-Based Testing is a testing technique where testers use a predefined list of items or criteria to ensure that all necessary aspects of the software have been tested. The checklist serves as a guide to help testers remember important areas to cover during the testing process.
