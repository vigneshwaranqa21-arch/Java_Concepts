1. Write 3 examples explaining importance of testing?

	It helps detect UI, usability, and functional issues that automation might miss.
    It’s essential for critical areas like payments, checkout flows, and mobile app behavior.

2. Write main difference between QA & QC? Where QA is applicable & where QC is applicable?    
| Aspect              | QA (Quality Assurance)                                                 | QC (Quality Control)                                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition          | Process-oriented – ensures proper processes to build quality software. | Product-oriented – ensures the final product meets quality standards. |
| Focus               | Preventing defects.                                                    | Finding defects.                                                      |
| When applicable     | During software development process.                                   | During testing and after build completion.                        |



3.What is a Software Defect?

A software defect (bug) is a mismatch between the expected result and the actual result in the application.
It means the software does not behave as intended according to requirements.

4. Write a template for Test case.

| Field               | Description                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Test Case ID    | Unique ID (e.g., TC_001)                  |
| Test Scenario   | Brief description of what is being tested |
| Preconditions   | Setup or conditions required before test  |
| Test Steps      | Steps to perform the test                 |
| Expected Result | What should happen                        |
| Actual Result   | What actually happened                    |
| Status          | Pass / Fail                               |
| Comments        | Additional notes (if any)                 |


5. Explain STLC. - Software Testing Life Cycle

STLC defines the sequence of steps to ensure software quality.
Phases:

Requirement Analysis

Test Planning

Test Case Design

Test Environment Setup

Test Execution

Defect Reporting

Test Closure

It ensures testing is systematic and traceable.
