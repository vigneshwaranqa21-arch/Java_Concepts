Manualtesting questions 

1. Write 3 examples explaining importance of testing?

	It helps detect UI, usability, and functional issues that automation might miss.
    It’s essential for critical areas like payments, checkout flows, and mobile app behavior.

2. Write main difference between QA & QC? Where QA is applicable & where QC is applicable?    
| Aspect              | QA (Quality Assurance)                                                 | QC (Quality Control)                                                  |

| **Definition**      | Process-oriented – ensures proper processes to build quality software. | Product-oriented – ensures the final product meets quality standards. |
| **Focus**           | Preventing defects.                                                    | Finding defects.                                                      |
| **When applicable** | During **software development process**.                               | During **testing and after build completion**.                        |



3.What is a Software Defect?
A software defect (bug) is a mismatch between the expected result and the actual result in the application.
It means the software does not behave as intended according to requirements.

5. Explain STLC. - Software Testing Life Cycle

STLC defines the sequence of steps to ensure software quality.
Phases:

Requirement Analysis

Test Planning

Test Case Design

Test Environment Setup

Test Execution

Defect Reporting

Test Closure

🧠 It ensures testing is systematic and traceable.


6. Advantages of Agile over Waterfall Model

Agile is iterative & flexible, while Waterfall is linear & rigid.

Agile allows frequent feedback and early defect detection.

Working software is delivered in short cycles (sprints).

Encourages collaboration and adaptability to change.


7. Difference between SDLC and STLC ?

Aspect	    SDLC	                                                STLC
Full Form	Software Development Life Cycle               	        Software Testing Life Cycle
Focus	    Covers the entire development process	                Focuses only on testing phase
Stages	    Requirement → Design → Coding → Testing → Deployment	Requirement → Test Planning → Execution → Closure
Goal	    Build the product	                                    Ensure the product’s quality


8. What is a Sprint in Agile? What is Scrum Meeting?

Sprint: A short, time-boxed period (usually 2–4 weeks) in which a specific set of features is developed and tested.

Scrum Meeting: A daily stand-up meeting (15 mins) to discuss progress, blockers, and next steps.


9.Explain about Kanban Board?

A Kanban Board is a visual tool used in Agile to track workflow.
It has columns like To Do → In Progress → Testing → Done.
It helps teams visualize tasks, limit work in progress, and improve flow efficiency.



10.What is V-model?

The V-model is a software development model that emphasizes verification and validation.

The V-Model (Verification and Validation model) is an extension of the Waterfall model.
Each development phase has a corresponding testing phase arranged in a “V” shape.

Example:

Requirement ↔ Acceptance Testing

Design ↔ Integration Testing

Coding ↔ Unit Testing



11. Difference between Blackbox and Whitebox Testing:
Blackbox tests functionality without seeing internal code.
Whitebox tests internal logic and code structure.
Blackbox = User perspective; Whitebox = Developer perspective.

12. What is Non-Functional Testing? Give some examples:
Non-Functional Testing checks performance, usability, security, and reliability.
It ensures the system’s behavior under specific conditions.
Examples: Load Testing, Stress Testing, Security Testing.

13. Explain the significance of Integration Testing:
Integration Testing checks data flow and interaction between modules.
It ensures combined modules work together properly.
It helps catch interface and communication defects early.

14. Browser and Device Testing Scenario:
Testing a site on different browsers or devices is Compatibility Testing.
It ensures the application works consistently across environments.
Finding a defect in iPhone 6 means device compatibility issue.

15. Define Accessibility Testing and its importance:
Accessibility Testing ensures the application is usable by people with disabilities.
It checks screen readers, color contrast, and keyboard navigation.
It promotes equal access and compliance with accessibility standards.

16. Navigate to this page https://www.saucedemo.com and  Write Testcase for Products page.

Test Case ID: TC_001
Test Case Description: Verify product list is displayed correctly on Products page.

Precondition: User logged in successfully.

Test Steps: Navigate to Products page → Check product images, names, and prices.

Expected Result: All products display with correct image, name, and price details.

Status: Pass/Fail



17.What is Domain Requirements? Explain with examples.

Domain Requirements define business-specific rules and logic for the application.
They describe how the software should behave in a particular industry.

Example: In Banking — Interest calculation; 
         In E-commerce — Cart and Payment flow

18. Benefits of RTM?

RTM ensures complete test coverage by linking requirements to test cases.
It helps track missing or untested functionalities easily.
It provides clear traceability from requirement to defect closure.



19.Prepare a sample RTM document for E-commerce / Banking application ?

 Sample 
 RTM (E-commerce):

| Req ID | Requirement | Test Case ID | Status | Defect ID |
| R001   | User Login  | TC_001       | Passed | -         |
| R002   | Add to Cart | TC_005       | Failed | D_002     |
| R003   | Payment     | TC_010       | Passed | -         |

20. What are all the Entry criteria needed to start Testing?

Approved test plan, test cases, stable build, test environment ready.

21. What are all the deliverables you provide to stake holder after test completion?

Test Summary Report, Defect Report, RTM, Closure Report.

22.What are all the factors need to confirm that your System Testing is complete? 

All test cases executed, major bugs fixed, exit criteria met.

23. Test Execution Report is the deliverable for Entry criteria or Exit criteria? Give reason for the same.

Test Execution Report → Exit Criteria: Because it’s shared after execution to confirm test completion.
